Welcome to tetra3!
==================

*tetra3 is a fast lost-in-space plate solver for star trackers written in Python.*

Use it to identify stars in images and get the corresponding direction (i.e. right ascension and
declination) in the sky which the camera points to and indentification of the stars. tetra3
supports solving distorted images and a wide range of field of view. The default database is
built for 10 to 30 degrees with stars down to magnitude 7, but you can easily build for any
application down to a few degrees.

 **NOTE:**
 In June 2023 the ``master`` branch of tetra3 was updated with a long list of improvements. This may
 cause some compatibility issues. Please use the ``legacy`` branch in the interim and open an issue
 on GitHub to discuss changes and resolve any problems.

The software is available in the `tetra3 GitHub repository <https://github.com/esa/tetra3>`_.

Performance will vary, but in general solutions will take 10 milliseconds (excluding time to extract
star positions from images) with 10 arcsecond (50 microradian) accuracy. The algorith is a pure
lost-in-space solver, so it does not require any prior pointing information.

A camera with a field of view (FOV) of about 10 degrees and at least 512 by 512 pixels is a good
starting point for general star tracking applications. Your camera should be able to acquire stars
down to magnitude 7 for best results. (For a narrower FOV camera, you need to be able to capture
dimmer stars.)

To effectively use tetra3 with your camera you may need to build a database optimised for your use
case. The Yale Bright Star Catalog, and the Hipparcos and Tyco Catalogues are supported for
generating databases; see the API documentation.

A real-world set of images acquired with a FLIR Blackfly S BFS-U3-31S4M-C (Sony IMX265 sensor;
binned 2x2) camera and a Fujifilm HF35XA-5M 35mm f/1.9 lens are included as test data (11.4 degrees
FOV).
